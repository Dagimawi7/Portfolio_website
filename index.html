            <p>
                I am Dagimawi Tamrat, a passionate software engineer graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Boston in December 2024. With a strong foundation in front-end development, I am skilled in technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase Authentication, and proficient in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I led the development of a cancer screening web application at Peek, where I created a user-friendly interface and implemented secure login systems, video playback, and report generation features to assist medical professionals. Additionally, my experience includes simulating swarm robotics behavior using Python, demonstrating my ability to work with multi-threaded applications and coordinate real-time processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Co-President of the Google Developer Student Clubs, I spearheaded initiatives such as workshops, hackathons, and tech talks, resulting in a 40% increase in membership and enhanced community engagement. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to connect and collaborate on innovative projects. Let’s work together to build transformative solutions!
